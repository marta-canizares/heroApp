# HeroApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.10.

## Install dependencies
Install dependencies with `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Json Server

If you don't have installed Json server, please install with: `npm install -g json-server`

Run `json-server db.json` for a new server.

The information is in db.json but if the object with the heroes doesn't appear, copy the information from /assets/data.json and paste in db.json.

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

Now is ready to use!

Thanks.
